django-blog
===========

A very basic blog app for Django. 

The original work was done by Nathan Borrow at https://github.com/nathanborror/django-basic-apps/.

I extracted just the blog app because I needed it in several projects. I also updated it to work with the django-twitter app I wrote myself.

The Basic Auth method of posting Twitter statuses has been disabled by Twitter as of September, 2010. Therefore I had to update the blog code.

TODO: type this up :)
